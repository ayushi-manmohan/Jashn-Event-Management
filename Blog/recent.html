               <p class="article-body">As the saying goes, girls just wanna have fun! And what is more fun than a kitty
                  party where everyone can let their hair down? If you want your kitty party to be fun, you are at the
                  right place. <br>The highlight of
                  kitty parties is the food. With some exquisite starters
                  and a light main course and everyone&#8217s favourite &#8217desserts&#8217.<br> So, while there is the
                  obvious “kitty” to look
                  forward to, there are also some great snacks that your girls can delight in. <br>Themed kitty
                  parties are so much more fun than regular kitty parties. Creative themes add a factor of excitement
                  to these monthly gatherings.
                  We bring to you unique kitty party themes that are very different from the regular
                  &#8217retro&#8217 and
                  &#8217Bollywood&#8217 themes. What are you waiting for? </p>

               <p class="article-body">"What could be better than a day full of activities with friends? Of course,
                  everything depends on your budget, and the activities offered are different depending on the regions,
                  however, Jashn made the party so awesome with our limited budget. Their planners
                  arranged everything
                  that pleased everyone! They gave a very nice souvenir that
                  I as the
                  groom
                  will never forget. </br> It is a long-anticipated
                  pre-wedding
                  tradition that brings together the groom&#8217s closest friends for a
                  night or
                  weekend of debauchery and fun. This celebration is deeply rooted in history, and for me, it&#8217s a
                  celebration of the people getting married and for them to de-stress before the big day. Jash is very
                  creative with the bachelor parties, as it is more than likely a once in a lifetime
                  celebration. This is the groom&#8217s “last night of freedom,” and
                  that&#8217s why it&#8217s memorable!" </br>

               <p class="article-body">"I&#8217m one of those people who has often been really depressed on her
                  birthday.
                  Growing up in a dirt poor, dysfunctional home, my birthdays weren&#8217t exactly great. My mom long
                  had a
                  habit of doing whatever she wanted to do, and often, she&#8217d put in a whole lot of effort but it
                  wasn&#8217t
                  usually about me and what I wanted at all.<br>Obviously,
                  my negative birthday experiences impacted
                  me and the way I feel about celebrating my own
                  daughter&#8217s birthday. It&#8217s important to me to not repeat the same cycles that made me
                  feel
                  terrible
                  growing up. And it&#8217s important to me that my kid grows up with plenty of great memories
                  she
                  can
                  hold onto.
                  <br>
                  I want her to feel loved, worth celebrating, and really secure in our bond. There&#8217s a lot
                  that I
                  can&#8217t control in this world — I can&#8217t help how I was raised, or the fact that her
                  dad
                  isn&#8217t very
                  active in her life.
                  <br>
                  But as long as I have a choice, I want to do everything I can to make her birthdays special.
                  That&#8217s
                  why we have a party every single year. Even before I got back on my feet after the pregnancy, I
                  decided that fabulous birthday parties were going to be a priority in my life as a single
                  mother.
                  I&#8217d set aside money throughout the year, shop sales — anything to make it happen.
                  Thanks to Jashn I was able to fulfill my this dream."
