                  everything depends on your budget, and the activities offered are different depending on the regions,
                  however, Jashn made the party so awesome with our limited budget. Their planners
                  arranged everything
                  that pleased everyone! They gave a very nice souvenir that
                  I as the
                  groom
                  will never forget.<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2"></br> It is a long-anticipated
                     pre-wedding
                     tradition that brings together the groom&#8217s closest friends for a
                     night or
                     weekend of debauchery and fun. This celebration is deeply rooted in history, and for me, it&#8217s
                     a
                     celebration of the people getting married and for them to de-stress before the big day. <br>Jashn
                     is
                     very
                     creative with the bachelor parties, as it is more than likely a once in a lifetime
                     celebration. This is the groom&#8217s “last night of freedom,” and
                     that&#8217s why it&#8217s memorable!" </br>

               <p class="article-body">"I&#8217m one of those people who has often been really depressed on her
                  birthday.
                  Growing up in a dirt poor, dysfunctional home, my birthdays weren&#8217t exactly great. My mom long
                  had a
                  habit of doing whatever she wanted to do, and often, she&#8217d put in a whole lot of effort but it
                  wasn&#8217t
                  usually about me and what I wanted at all.<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3"><br>Obviously,
                     my negative birthday experiences impacted
                     me and the way I feel about celebrating my own
                     daughter&#8217s birthday. It&#8217s important to me to not repeat the same cycles that made me
                     feel
                     terrible
                     growing up. And it&#8217s important to me that my kid grows up with plenty of great memories
                     she
                     can
                     hold onto.
                     <br>
                     I want her to feel loved, worth celebrating, and really secure in our bond. There&#8217ts a lot
                     that I
                     can&#8217t control in this world — I can&#8217t help how I was raised, or the fact that her
                     dad
                     isn&#8217t very
                     active in her life.
                     <br>
                     But as long as I have a choice, I want to do everything I can to make her birthdays special.
                     That&#8217s
                     why we have a party every single year. Even before I got back on my feet after the pregnancy, I
                     decided that fabulous birthday parties were going to be a priority in my life as a single
                     mother.
                     I&#8217d set aside money throughout the year, shop sales — anything to make it happen.
                     Thanks to Jashn I was able to fulfill my this dream."
